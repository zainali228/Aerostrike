**How** **to** **Use** **Aerostrike**

**1.** **Interface** **Selection**

When the tool starts:

> ● It automatically detects available WiFi interfaces
>
> ● Shows only the interfaces that support monitor mode
>
> ● If a wrong or unsupported interface is selected, it displays a warning

**2.** **Wireless** **Scanning**

Adjust Time and Press **Start** **Scan**

The tool will automatically:

✔ Enable monitor mode

✔ Scan all nearby WiFi networks 

✔ Detect all Nearby Access Points

✔ Display SSID, BSSID, Channel, Vendor, Signal Strength, Encryption & Connected Clients etc.

**Live** **logs** **are** **shown** **directly** **in** **the** **GUI.**

**3.** **Attack** **Options**

> **1.** **Test** **All** **(Autonomous** **Mode)**

The Test All option in Aerostrike is fully autonomous.

If you want Default Credentials Check, WEP Attack, WPS PIN Attack, IP Address Detection, WPA Handshake Capture, Port Scanning to run automatically, you simply click Test All.

In this mode, the tool:

> ● Analyzes all detected networks
>
> ● Starts with the strongest signal network
> 
> ● Then tests each network one by one

For every network, the tool automatically performs:

> ● Default Credentials Check
> 
> ● WEP Attack
>
> ● WPS PIN Attack
>
> ● IP Address Detection
>
> ● WPA Handshake Capture
> 
> ● Port Scanning
>
> **2.** **Manual** **Attack** **Modules** **(Single** **Network)**

If you want to test a speciﬁc network manually, Aerostrike gives you complete manual control.

After selecting any single network, you can choose which attack you want to run. 
The available manual options include:

> ● WPA Handshake Capture
> 
> ● WPS PIN Attack
>
> ● WEP Attack
>
> ● Default Credentials Check

The beneﬁt of this mode is that you can perform only the attack you need, without running full automation.

**4.** **Post‑Exploitation**

After Aerostrike captures a handshake and retrieves a password, it will ask:

**Which** **network** **do** **you** **want** **to** **connect** **to?**

Once selected, the tool will:

✔ Automatically connect 

✔ Scan the internal network 

✔ Detect live devices

✔ Perform vulnerability analysis 

✔ Identify open ports and services

**5.** **Network** **Monitoring**

Real‑time monitoring includes:

> ● Suspicious device alerts
> 
> ● Packet anomaly analysis
> 
> ● Trafﬁc spikes
>
> ● Live graphs & logs

**6.** **AI** **Security** **Helper** **(API** **Key** **Required)**

Aerostrike includes a smart AI assistant that:

> ● Explains attack options
>
> ● Recommends the best strategy
>
> ● Suggests ﬁxes and security improvements
> 
> ● Auto‑generates report explanations
>
> ● Helps beginners navigate every feature

**7.** **Professional** **Reporting** **System**

Aerostrike provides a powerful and ﬂexible reporting engine that can generate high-quality security reports based on your scans and attacks.

> **1.** **Simple** **Report** **(Without** **API** **Key)**

If you don’t have an API key, you can still use the standard reporting mode.

In this mode, Aerostrike will generate:

> ● A complete PDF report
>
> ● All ﬁndings from scanning
> 
> ● All attack results
>
> ● Device details, vulnerabilitie, and logs
>
> ● Local risk scoring and recommendations

Everything discovered during scanning and attacking is included inside a single, clean, professional report.

> **2.** **Advance** **Reports** **(If** **API** **Key** **Available)**

If you have an API key, Aerostrike unlocks advanced features:

> ● Full PDF security reports
>
> ● Summary + detailed CVE-based analysis
> 
> ● Device-level risk scoring
>
> ● Complete attack logs
>
> ● Recommendations section
> 
> ● Graphs and visual charts

This allows you to get professional-grade, real-time security advice directly in your report.

**8.** **Advanced** **Settings**

The **Advanced** **Settings** tab provides powerful conﬁguration options that allow you to fully customize how Aerostrike performs each attack.

Inside this section, you can:

✔ **Attack-Speciﬁc** **Conﬁguration**

You can modify the settings for every attack type individually, such as:

> ● WAP Attack:Custom wordlist selection, Deauthentication Packet Count, Capture Timeout (Seconds)
>
> ● WPS Attack: WPS PIN list selection, WPS Attack Timeout (Seconds), Max Pin Attempts
>
> ● WEP Attack: WEP Attack Timeout (Seconds), IV Collection Goal
> 
> ●Default Credentials: Default Credentials List
>
> ● Scanning: Channel Hop Interval (Seconds), Default Scan Time (Seconds)

✔ **Interface** **Management**

You can conﬁgure network interfaces, including:

> ● Toggle monitor Mode, Refresh interfaces, Test Packet Injection

✔ **General** **Setting**

You can switch the tool’s appearance at any time:

> ● Dark mode
